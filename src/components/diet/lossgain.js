            <h5>Cut back on refined carbs</h5>
            <p>
              One way to lose weight quickly is to cut back on sugars and
              starches, or carbohydrates. This could be with a low carb eating
              plan or by reducing refined carbs and replacing them with whole
              grains.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a low carb eating plan, you’ll utilize burning stored fat for
              energy instead of carbs.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you choose to eat more complex carbs like whole grains along
              with a calorie deficit, you’ll benefit from higher fiber and
              digest them more slowly. This makes them more filling to keep you
              satisfied.

              <li>
                A protein source
                <p>
                  Healthy protein sources like Meat, fish and seafood, eggs,
                  plant-based protein
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Fat source
                <p>Don’t be afraid of eating fats.</p>
                <p>
                  Your body still requires healthy fats no matter what eating
                  plan you choose. Olive oil and avocado oil are great choices
                  for including in your eating plan.
